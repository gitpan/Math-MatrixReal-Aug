Math/MatrixReal/Aug version 0.01
================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DESCRIPTION 

This module provides some additional methods for Math::MatrixReal
in the tradition of Math::MatrixReal::Ext1.  These include:

augmentright() and augmentbelow(): make new (larger) matrices from old
(smaller) ones. 

fill() and newfill(): fill matrices with constants.

applyfunction(): applies a specified function to each element of a
matrix.

largeexponential(): raises a matrix to a large, positive integer power
relatively quickly.

See Aug.pm for more information.

Hopefully these will be integrated into Math::MatrixReal soon so that
this module can be swept onto the dustbin of history.
